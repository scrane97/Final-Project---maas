                          whether it is more common to be killed working abroad or at home, which countries are journalists most threatened by death while working, 
                          if most journalists killed in war zones were working freelance, and is there a correlation between gender and method killed? We also aim 
                          to show what the implications of pursuing journalism and free media are and to see if there a more strategic and common pattern of attack 
                          against journalists. These questions and their answers are aimed to help give insight as to what level of free media comes out of these 
                          countries and what political/social/economic implications there might be. They can also help people understand the threat against journalists 
                          in these places.
